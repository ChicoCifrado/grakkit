**It's the fusion of GraalVM and Bukkit.** Grakkit is designed to allow the use of JavaScript within Minecraft -- a simple concept with infinite potential.

# Getting Started

## Grakkit Basics
This section will contain information about the general grakkit environment.

## Your First Code
This section will detail an in-depth explanatory example to demonstrate what your first code may look like.

## The Next Step
This section will expand on the above example to show off grakkit's potential, and guide users to the wiki for more information.

# Miscellaneous

## Legacy Support
Grakkit theoretically supports Minecraft versions going back to beta 1.4, given you have bukkit installed. This legacy support does not extend to modules, and likely never will. If you do intend to use grakkit on a beta or legacy release version, you may run into unexpected problems, however the `index.js` file should work properly in its default state.

## A note about ScriptCraft
We fully respect and support ScriptCraft and what it did. For us, at least in part, Grakkit is a continuation of what ScriptCraft aimed to do, with plenty of our own ideas and features thrown in. **We don't intend to start a rivalry between supporters of the two frameworks.**
