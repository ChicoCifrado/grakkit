**It's the fusion of GraalVM and Bukkit.** Grakkit is designed to allow the use of JavaScript within Minecraft -- a simple concept with infinite potential.

**This plugin is NOT for beginners!** If you are new to JavaScript, we highly recommend you try [ScriptCraft](https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft) as its ecosystem is geared towards newcomers.

# Getting Started

## Installation
This section will explain how to install grakkit properly.
<!--
We've created installers for you to use when installing GraalVM and Grakkit.

**Downloads:** [Windows Installer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grakkit/grakkit/master/installer/grakkit.exe) | [Linux Installer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grakkit/grakkit/master/installer/grakkit)

If you're new to minecraft server development, just run your platform's installer as-is. If you already have a server running, run the installer with the `--noserver` command line argument.

Users who directly created their server with the installer can use the `--nograal` flag to update their server to the latest minecraft version without re-installing GraalVM.

## Grakkit Basics
This section will contain information about the general grakkit environment.

## Your First Code
This section will detail an in-depth explanatory example to demonstrate what your first code may look like.

## The Next Step
This section will expand on the above example to show off grakkit's potential, and guide users to the wiki for more information.

# Miscellaneous

## Legacy Support
Grakkit theoretically supports Minecraft versions going back to beta 1.4, given you have bukkit installed. This legacy support does not extend to modules, and likely never will. If you do intend to use grakkit on a beta or legacy release version, you may run into unexpected problems, however the `index.js` file should work properly in its default state.

## A note about ScriptCraft
We fully respect and support ScriptCraft and what it did. For us, at least in part, Grakkit is a continuation of what ScriptCraft aimed to do, with plenty of our own ideas and features thrown in. **We don't intend to start a rivalry between supporters of the two plugins.**
